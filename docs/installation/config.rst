.. _installation_environment_config:

===================================
Environment configuration reference
===================================

Open Forms can be ran both as a Docker container or directly on a VPS or
dedicated server. It depends on other services, such as database and cache
backends, which can be configured through environment variables.

You also need to expose Open Forms through a web server acting as a reverse proxy, such
as nginx or your ingress solution on Kubernetes. See the
:ref:`installation_config_webserver` section for some configuration recommendations.

Available environment variables
===============================

  should generate one via
  `miniwebtool <https://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/>`_

* ``ALLOWED_HOSTS``: A comma separated (without spaces!) list of domains that
  serve the installation. Used to protect against ``Host`` header attacks.
  Defaults to ``*`` for the ``docker`` environment and defaults to
  ``127.0.0.1,localhost`` for the ``dev`` environment.

Processing of submissions
-------------------------

Submissions are :ref:`processed <developers_backend_core_submissions>` in the background after the
end-user has submitted the form data. This can fail because of external factors, and
Open Forms has an automatic-retry mechanism.

The following settings allow you to tweak the parameters of this mechanism.

* ``RETRY_SUBMISSIONS_INTERVAL``: the interval (in seconds) of retrying. Defaults to
  every 300s (5 min).

* ``RETRY_SUBMISSIONS_TIME_LIMIT``: the time limit from when the submission was
  submitted that automatic retries will continue. After this time limit has elapsed,
  there are no automatic retries anymore, but manual retries are still available.
  Defaults to ``48`` hours.

Other settings
--------------

* ``MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE``: configure the maximum allowed file upload size. See
  :ref:`installation_file_uploads` for more details. The default is ``50M``.

* ``DEBUG``: Used for more traceback information on development environment.
  Various other security settings are derived from this setting! Defaults to
  ``True`` for the ``dev`` environment, otherwise defaults to ``False``.

* ``IS_HTTPS``: Used to construct absolute URLs and controls a variety of
  security settings. Defaults to the inverse of ``DEBUG``.

* ``DB_ENGINE``: Backend to use as database system. See
  `Django DATABASE settings`_ for a full list of backends. Only the default is
  supported but others might work. Defaults to ``django.db.backends.postgresql``

* ``CACHE_DEFAULT``: The default Redis cache location. Defaults to
  ``localhost:6379/0``.

* ``CACHE_AXES``: The Redis cache location for Axes (used to prevent brute
  force attacks). Defaults to ``localhost:6379/0``.

* ``CACHE_OIDC``: The Redis cache location for the OIDC configuration. Defaults
  to ``localhost:6379/0``.

* ``ENVIRONMENT``: Short string to indicate the environment (test, production,
  etc.) Defaults to ``""``.

* ``GIT_SHA``: The Git commit hash belonging to the code running the instance.
  Defaults to the automatically determined commit hash, if the application is
  run from a checked out Git repository.

* ``RELEASE``: The version of the application. If not provided, the
  ``GIT_SHA`` is used.

* ``SDK_RELEASE``: The version of the SDK bundled. By default, this is sourced from the
  ``.sdk-release`` file and should only be overridden if you're doing things in custom
  Docker images. The value is used to know which SDK JS/CSS files to include on the form
  detail page.

* ``SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE``: Controls if sessions expire at browser close.
  This applies to both the session of end-users filling out forms and staff using the
  administrative interface. Enabling this forces users to log in every time they open
  their browser. Defaults to ``False``.

* ``EXTRA_VERIFY_CERTS``: A comma-separated list of paths to certificates to trust, empty
  by default. If you're using self-signed certificates for the services that Open Forms
  communicates with, specify the path to those (root) certificates here, rather than
  disabling SSL certificate verification. Example:
  ``EXTRA_VERIFY_CERTS=/etc/ssl/root1.crt,/etc/ssl/root2.crt``.

* ``SELF_CERTIFI_DIR``: Temporary directory where the generated bundle of
  ``EXTRA_VERIFY_CERTS`` will be stored.

* ``CACHE_PORTALOCKER``: Redis URL for file locks. Defaults to ``localhost:6379/0``.

* ``DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_REQUESTS``: The default timeout duration (in seconds) when calling
  external APIs/services. Defaults to ``10.0``. Requests taking longer than this
  duration are aborted and errors bubble up. Specific calls may use an explicitly
  provided timeout, which is not affected by this setting.

* ``CURL_CA_BUNDLE``: If this variable is set to an empty string, it disables SSL/TLS
  certificate verification. More information about why can be found on this
  `stackoverflow post <https://stackoverflow.com/a/48391751/7146757>`_. Even calls from
  Open Forms to any other service will be disabled, so this variable should be used with
  care to prevent unwanted side-effects.

* ``BEAT_SEND_EMAIL_INTERVAL``: the interval (in seconds) of sending queued e-mails,
  defaults to ``20``.

* ``SUBMISSION_REPORT_URL_TOKEN_TIMEOUT_DAYS``: Configure how many days the URL to the submission report is usable.

* ``TEMPORARY_UPLOADS_REMOVED_AFTER_DAYS``: Configure how many days before unclaimed temporary uploads are removed.

* ``OPENFORMS_LOCATION_CLIENT``: The client to be used for auto filling a street name and city
  when given a postcode and house number.  Defaults to our internal BAG configuration.

* ``ENABLE_THROTTLING``: Enable or disable request throttling (to protect against (D)DOS, for example). Default enabled.

* ``THROTTLE_RATE_ANON``: Default throttle rate for anonymous users (this includes the
  end-users filling out (embedded) forms using the SDK!). Defaults to ``2500/hour``. Note
  that if throttling is disabled altogether, this configuration parameter has no effect.

* ``THROTTLE_RATE_USER``: Default throttle rate for authenticated users (typicall users
  logged in to the admin interface). Defaults to ``15000/hour``. Note that if throttling
  is disabled altogether, this configuration parameter has no effect.

* ``THROTTLE_RATE_POLLING``: Throttle rate for endpoints that are polled frequently. If
  you're authenticated as staff user, the throttling is bypassed completely. Defaults
  to ``50000/hour``. Note that if throttling is disabled altogether, this configuration
  parameter has no effect.

* ``NUM_PROXIES``: The number of application proxies that the API runs behind. See the
  `upstream documentation <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/settings/#num_proxies>`_
  for more context. Defaults to ``1``.

* ``TWO_FACTOR_FORCE_OTP_ADMIN``: Enforce 2 Factor Authentication in the admin or not.
  Default ``True``. You'll probably want to disable this when using OIDC.

* ``TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN``: Whether to use the 2 Factor Authentication login flow for
  the admin or not. Default ``True``. You'll probably want to disable this when using OIDC.

* ``FORMS_EXPORT_REMOVED_AFTER_DAYS``: The number of days after which zip files of exported forms should be deleted.
  Defaults to 7 days.

Specifying the environment variables
=====================================

There are two strategies to specify the environment variables:

* provide them in a ``.env`` file
* start the component processes (with uwsgi/gunicorn/celery) in a process
  manager that defines the environment variables

Providing a .env file
---------------------

This is the most simple setup and easiest to debug. The ``.env`` file must be
at the root of the project - i.e. on the same level as the ``src`` directory (
NOT *in* the ``src`` directory).

The syntax is key-value:

.. code::

   SOME_VAR=some_value
   OTHER_VAR="quoted_value"


Provide the envvars via the process manager
-------------------------------------------

If you use a process manager (such as supervisor/systemd), use their techniques
to define the envvars. The component will pick them up out of the box.


.. _installation_config_webserver:

Webserver configuration
=======================

Permissions policy
------------------

The ``Permissions-Policy`` response header controls which browser feature may be used/
requested by Open Forms. For privacy and security reasons you may want to disable most
of the features, except the following:

* ``camera=(self)``: file upload components with images may use the camera feature to
  take pictures for upload.
* ``geolocation=(self)``: when using the map component, Open Forms will try to get the
  geolocation from the browser.

SSL/TLS
-------

Typically your webserver terminates SSL/TLS. Therefore, we recommend you to apply the
``Strict-Transport-Security`` response header to instruct browser to only connect over
HTTPS with Open Forms.
