===========================
Embedding the SDK in a page
===========================

The SDK can be embedded by loading the Javascript code and stylesheet.

Assuming the SDK is hosted on ``https://example.com/sdk/1.0.0/``, two resources need to be
loaded.

Before you embed a particular version of the SDK, please familiarize yourself with the
:ref:`versioning policy <developers_versioning>`.

Loading static assets
=====================

1. The default stylesheet

    .. code-block:: html

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://example.com/sdk/1.0.0/open-forms-sdk.css" />

2. The Javascript code

    .. code-block:: html

        <script src="https://example.com/sdk/1.0.0/open-forms-sdk.js"></script>

Calling the SDK
===============

Once the Javascript is loaded, the module ``OpenForms`` is available. To initialize
a form, use the constructor and initialize the form:

.. code-block:: js

    const form = new OpenForms.OpenForm(element, options);
    form.init();

Where ``element`` is a valid DOM node and ``options`` an options Object, see
:ref:`developers_sdk_embedding_options`.

.. _developers_sdk_embedding_options:

Available options
-----------------

``baseUrl``:
    Required. The API root of the Open Forms backend server. Note that this server must
    be configured to allow Cross Origin requests (CORS) from the domain where the SDK is
    used.

``formId``:
    Required. The UUID or slug of the form to embed. This can be obtained via the Open
    Forms admin interface.

``basePath``:
    Optional, but highly recommended. The SDK considers this as the base URL and builds all
    URLs relatively to this URL. If not provided, ``window.location.pathname`` is used.

``CSPNonce``:
    Recommended. The page's CSP Nonce value if inline styles are blocked by your
    `Content Security Policy <https://content-security-policy.com/nonce/>`_. The Open
    Forms SDK renders HTML in a number of places that may contain inline styles (as the
    result of a WYSYWIG editor). If a nonce is provided, the inline styles receive the
    value. Otherwise the styles will be blocked. This is not required if you have
    ``style-src 'unsafe-inline'`` as part of your policy.

``lang``:
    Optional language to use for internationalizing. By default, this is looked up from
    the ``lang`` attribute of the ``html`` element in the DOM - if this is not set, the
    default value of ``'nl'`` is used.

``sentryDSN``:
    A `Sentry DSN <https://docs.sentry.io/>`_ to monitor the SDK.

``sentryEnv``:
    The label of the Sentry environment to use, for example ``'production'``. Used in
    combination with ``sentryDSN``. Defaults to an empty string.

Content Security Policy (CSP)
-----------------------------

When you are embedding the SDK on your page, it must behave according to your Content
Security Policy.

Certain components have :ref:`specific CSP requirements <developers_csp_sdk_embedding>`.

Full example
============

.. code-block:: html

    <!-- Load stylesheet and SDK bundle -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://example.com/sdk/1.0.0/open-forms-sdk.css" />
    <script src="https://example.com/sdk/1.0.0/open-forms-sdk.js"></script>

    <!-- Load a form and render it -->
    <div
      id="openforms-root"
      data-base-url="https://openforms.example.com/api/v1/"
      data-form-id="0d2f5453-8987-43dd-952e-aad3dd8f2318"
      data-base-path="/some-cms-page"
    ></div>
    <script>
      var targetNode = document.getElementById('openforms-root');
      var form = new OpenForms.OpenForm(targetNode, targetNode.dataset);
      form.init();
    </script>

Deploying the SDK
=================

The SDK is published as container image on
`Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/openformulieren/open-forms-sdk>`_, containing
the static Javascript and CSS assets:

* ``open-forms-sdk.js`` and
* ``open-forms-sdk.css``

When you're deploying the ``latest`` tag, these assets are available in the webroot,
e.g. ``http://localhost:8080/open-forms-sdk.js``.

When you're using a pinned version, such as ``1.0.0``, the assets are available in that
directory: ``http://localhost:8080/1.0.0/open-forms-sdk.js``.

The SDK follows semantic versioning.

Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
------------------------------------

Note that the backend must be configured to allow cross origin requests from the domains
that embed the SDK.

Additionally, you need to configure your infrastructure to allow CORS requests for the
font-files. An example nginx rule looks like this:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~* ^/static/.*\.(eot|ttf|woff|woff2|svg)$ {
        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;  # this header is crucial
        # delegate to uwsgi backend
        proxy_pass http://open-forms-backend:8000;
    }

Failing to configure this will result in the font files not being loaded and the UI
looking weird. Icons may also be broken.
